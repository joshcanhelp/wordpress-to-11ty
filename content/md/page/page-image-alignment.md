# Page Image Alignment

Welcome to image alignment! The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let’s get started.

On the topic of alignment, it should be noted that users can choose from the options of *None*, *Left*, *Right,* and *Center*. In addition, they also get the options of *Thumbnail*, *Medium*, *Large* &amp; *Fullsize*. Be sure to try this page in RTL mode and it should look the same as LTR.

![Image Alignment 580x300](/_images/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg "Image Alignment 580x300")

The image above happens to be ***centered***.

![Image Alignment 150x150](/_images/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150-1.jpg "Image Alignment 150x150") The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is ***left aligned***.

As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we’ll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it’s thang. Mission accomplished!

And now for a ***massively large image***. It also has ***no alignment***.

![Image Alignment 1200x400](/_images/2013/03/image-alignment-1200x4002-1.jpg "Image Alignment 1200x400")

The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.

And we try the large image again, with the center alignment since that sometimes is a problem. The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.

And now we’re going to shift things to the ***right align***. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there… Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don’t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don’t let anyone else tell you differently.

In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah… Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.

And just when you thought we were done, we’re going to do them all over again with captions!

![Image Alignment 580x300](/_images/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg "Image Alignment 580x300")Look at 580×300 getting some [caption](https://en.support.wordpress.com/images/image-settings/ "Image Settings") love.The image above happens to be ***centered***. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.

![Image Alignment 150x150](/_images/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150-1.jpg "Image Alignment 150x150")Bigger caption than the image usually is.The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is ***left aligned***.

As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too.

![Image Alignment 1200x400](/_images/2013/03/image-alignment-1200x4002-1.jpg "Image Alignment 1200x400")Comment for massive image for your eyeballs.The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.  
![Image Alignment 1200x400](/_images/2013/03/image-alignment-1200x4002-1.jpg "Image Alignment 1200x400")This massive image is centered.

And again with the big image centered. The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.

![Image Alignment 300x200](/_images/2013/03/image-alignment-300x200-1.jpg "Image Alignment 300x200")Feels good to be right all the time.And now we’re going to shift things to the ***right align***. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there… Hey guy! Way to rock that right side.

And that’s a wrap, yo! You survived the tumultuous waters of alignment. Image alignment achievement unlocked! Last thing is a small image aligned right. Whatever follows should be unaffected. ![Image Alignment 150x150](/_images/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150-1.jpg "Image Alignment 150x150")
