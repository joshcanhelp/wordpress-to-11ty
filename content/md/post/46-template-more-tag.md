# Template: More Tag

This content is before the [more tag](https://en.support.wordpress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/ "The More Tag").

Right after this sentence should be a “continue reading” button of some sort on list pages of themes that show full content. It won’t show on single pages or on themes showing excerpts.

And this content is after the more tag. (which should be the anchor link for when the button is clicked)
