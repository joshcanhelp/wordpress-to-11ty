# Block: Cover

This is a left aligned cover block with a background image.

The cover block lets you add text on top of images or videos.

This blocktype has several alignment options, and you can also align or center the text inside the block.

The background image can be fixed and you can change its opacity and add an overlay color.

Make sure that the text wraps correctly over the image, and that text markup and alignments are working.

The next image should have a pink overlay color, the text should be bold and aligned to the left:

**A center aligned cover image block, with a left aligned text.**

This is a full width cover block with a fixed background image with a 20% opacity.

Make sure that all the text is readable.

Our last cover image block has a wide width.

This is a wide cover block with a video background.

Compare the video and image blocks.  
This block is centered.

The block below has no alignment, and the text is a link. Overlay colors must also work with video backgrounds.
