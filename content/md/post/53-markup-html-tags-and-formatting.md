Blockquotes
-----------

Single line blockquote:

Multi line blockquote with a cite reference:

> The **HTML `` Element** (or *HTML Block Quotation Element*) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation (see [Notes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/blockquote#Notes) for how to change it). A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the **cite** attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the [``](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite "The HTML Citation Element  represents a reference to a creative work. It must include the title of a work or a URL reference, which may be in an abbreviated form according to the conventions used for the addition of citation metadata.") element.

HTML Tags
---------

These supported tags come from the WordPress.com code [FAQ](https://en.support.wordpress.com/code/ "Code").

**Address Tag**

1 Infinite Loop  
Cupertino, CA 95014  
United States**Anchor Tag (aka. Link)**

This is an example of a [link](https://wordpressfoundation.org/ "WordPress Foundation").

**Abbreviation Tag**

The abbreviation srsly stands for “seriously”.

**Acronym Tag (*deprecated in HTML5*)**

The acronym ftw stands for “for the win”.

**Big Tag** (*deprecated in HTML5*)

These tests are a big deal, but this tag is no longer supported in HTML5.

**Cite Tag**

“Code is poetry.” —Automattic

**Code Tag**

This tag styles blocks of code.  
`.post-title {	margin: 0 0 5px;	font-weight: bold;	font-size: 38px;	line-height: 1.2;	and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how it is handled and to find out how it overflows;}`  
You will learn later on in these tests that `word-wrap: break-word;` will be your best friend.

**Delete Tag**

This tag will let you <del cite="deleted it">strike out text</del>, but this tag is *recommended* supported in HTML5 (use the `` instead).

**Emphasize Tag**

The emphasize tag should *italicize* *text*.

**Horizontal Rule Tag**

- - - - - -

This sentence is following a `` tag.

**Insert Tag**

This tag should denote inserted text.

**Keyboard Tag**

This scarcely known tag emulates keyboard text, which is usually styled like the `` tag.

**Preformatted Tag**

This tag is for preserving whitespace as typed, such as in poetry or ASCII art.

The Road Not Taken

  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
  And sorry I could not travel both          (\_/)
  And be one traveler, long I stood         (='.'=)
  And looked down one as far as I could     (")_(")
  To where it bent in the undergrowth;

  Then took the other, as just as fair,
  And having perhaps the better claim,          |\_/|
  Because it was grassy and wanted wear;       / @ @ \
  Though as for that the passing there        ( > º < )
