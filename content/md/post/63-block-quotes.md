# Block: Quote

The quote block has two styles, regular:

> Gutenberg is more than an editor.
> 
> The Gutenberg Team  
> 

and large:

> Yes, it is a press, certainly, but a press from which shall flow in inexhaustible streams, the most abundant and most marvelous liquor that has ever flowed to relieve the thirst of men!
> 
>   
> *Johannes Gutenberg*  
> 

The quote blocks themselves have no alignments but the text can be aligned, bold, italic, and linked:

> ***[Right](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/themes/theme-support/)***
> 
> Theme Review  
> 

In addition to the quote block, we also have the *pull quote*, with a regular and a solid color style.

You can change the color of the border and the text with the regular style:

> In addition to the quote block, we also have the pull quote.
> 
> Theme Reviewer

Or change the background color and text color with the solid color style:

> a solid color style
> 
> Theme Reviewer
